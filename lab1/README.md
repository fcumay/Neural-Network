# This is Image Compression Programm (ICP).
  ICP is implemented for comress images using Neural Network Algorithm.
  
  It's have **two**  control modes.
  + **Using**. 
  NN read necessary weights from json-file, use it when you need to compress image.
  + **Learning**.
  NN have random values of its weights. It's a long process, so do not input little value of mistake.
      
  ### How to start
   Highly recommend you firstly choose 1-st and 3-th menu options to see how ICP work.
